## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
- Slack CodePath Prework Support

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
One of the first challenges that I encountered when completing this project was getting my "user guessed: 1" to show up on my console.log. I had many issues with this and tried many different ways to resolve the issue. I messaged the slack channel to seek help from TA's and other iterns that may be having the same issue. Thankfully Joseph Harrel, messaged me realatively quickly after seeing my message and was able to walk me through what he did to accomplish this step. It seemed that I was calling the console on the glitch platform and not the specific file itself. After receiving this advice, I was able to finally see the "user guessed: 1" on my console.log. Another issue that I ran into was figuring out how to push all of my code onto the main branch on Github. For this issue, I did not go onto the slack channel but I did watch the github video attached many times to get a better understanding of what I was meant to do. After watching the video about 3 times and making a couple mistakes committing to the main branch, I finally got all my work to appear on Github.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
After completing my submission, I am very curious on all of the different features that Github has on the platform and what they are all meant to achieve. When watching the video the Guiermo introduces some of the Github features and mentioned that we would learn the rest throughout the course, thus I would love to learn more about them. Additionally, although this project was only one page, I am interested in making a multiple page interactive website.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
If I had a few more hours to work through this project, I would improve the design side of the light and sound memory game. I find UX/UI design and Front-End Development extremely interesting and would have love to showcased my creativity within this product. In specific, I would have made the page more asthetically pleasing by changing the color scheme, the buttons, the placement of the text and the 4 buttons for the game. Additionally, I would have created a feature where two players can play against each other instead of it only being a single player game.
